## About the Video Course
Docker is a portable container format that allows you to run code anywhere from your desktop to the cloud. Docker's workflow makes development, testing, and deployment much easier and much faster. Optimizing Docker Workflows looks at your Docker-based workflow and analyzes problems looming in the future. 
This video course demonstrates various techniques and tools to make building Docker images faster. You will learn to master various ways to speed up deploying containers to your production environment. Towards the end of this video course, you will look at standard Linux tools for debugging and demonstrate how to use them to interact with containers.
